# Superquiz
Simple, easy to modify quiz for Arduino

A simple quiz program for Arduino, easily modified by just editing the question/answer array.

You can/should mess with the tones, the amount of questions, perhaps add a timer for each question?

I feel it's adequately commented so you even a beginner shouldn't have an issue finding their way around, infact, this was my first Arduino project.
